#Loading & tidying the data

Before we begin analysis on the data, we must first load and tidy the pups database. The code to do so is shown below:
``` {r problem 1, messages = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

pups_data = read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv",
                     col_types = "ciiiii") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = outcome, value = days, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>% 
  separate(outcome, into = c("remove", "dev_landmark"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-remove)

```
