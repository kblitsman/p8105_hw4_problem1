#Loading & tidying the data

Before we begin analysis on the data, we must first load and tidy the pups database. The code to do so is shown below:
``` {r problem 1, messages = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

pups_data = read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv",
                     col_types = "ciiiii") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = outcome, value = days, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>% 
  separate(outcome, into = c("remove", "dev_landmark"), sep = "_") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(days)) %>% 
  select(-remove)

ggplot(pups_data, aes(x = dev_landmark, y = days)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = dev_landmark), color = "blue") + stat_summary(fun.y = median, geom = "point", color = "blue", size = 4)

```

We analyzed the amount of post-natal days it takes for certain developmental landmarks to develop in puppies, using density violins to visualize the data. It appears that ears develop the quickest with median days being `r round(median(subset(pups_data, dev_landmark == "ears")$days),2)`, while eyes take the longest amount of days to develop, with a median of `r round(median(subset(pups_data, dev_landmark == "eyes")$days),2)` days.
